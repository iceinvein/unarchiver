## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Entitlements Justification
If Apple asks why you need specific entitlements:

- **files.user-selected.read-only**: Required to read archive files selected by user
- **files.user-selected.read-write**: Required to write extracted files to user-selected locations
- **files.downloads.read-write**: Common location for archive extraction
- **network.client**: Reserved for future features (can be removed if not needed)

### Known Limitations for MAS Build

- Quick Action/Finder extension may not work in sandboxed MAS build
- Consider removing Quick Action references from MAS version
- Auto-updater must be disabled (MAS handles updates)

### If Rejected

Common rejection reasons:
1. **Overly broad entitlements**: Remove network.client if not used
2. **Missing functionality**: Ensure app works fully in sandbox
3. **Crashes**: Test thoroughly before submission
4. **Misleading metadata**: Ensure screenshots match actual functionality

## üìä Post-Release

- [ ] Monitor App Store Connect Analytics
- [ ] Respond to user reviews
- [ ] Track crash reports
- [ ] Plan updates based on feedback

## üîÑ For Future Updates

1. Increment version in both package.json and tauri.conf.json
2. Update "What's New" in App Store Connect
3. Rebuild, re-sign, re-package
4. Upload and submit
